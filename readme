Enigma Machine:

The Enigma machines were a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect
commercial, diplomatic and military communication (Wikipedia). This project constructs a virtual representation of the Enigma machine used for the encryption
and decryption of secret messages. In constructing the machine, key physical components of the machine (Rotors,
Reflectors, Plugs and Plugboard) are simulated in order to encode and decode text messages.

Parts attempted and completed:

1) Part 1 - Modelling the Plugboard
2) Part 2 - Modelling the Rotors
3) Part 3 - Modelling the Reflector
4) Part 4 - Modelling Basic Rotors
5) Part 5 - Modelling the Enigma Machine
6) Part 6 - Reading and Writing Files
7) Part 7 - Modelling Turnover Rotors
8) Part 8 - Building a Bombe

The anwer of the three challenges for part 8 are:
   * challenge 1: DAISYDAISYGIVEMEYOURANSWERDO (missing letters in the plugs: T, A)
   * challenge 2: WELLALWAYSBETOGETHERHOWEVERFARITSEEMSWELLALWAYSBETOGETHERTOGETHERINELECTRICDREAMS (rotors are in positions: 3, 9 and  15)
   * challenge 3: ILOVECOFFEEILOVETEAILOVETHEJAVAJIVEANDITLOVESME (the rotor types are V, III and II)



Extensions: 

This project allows the user to choose the settings of the machine by calling the getUserSpecs method defined in the class named User.
The user can choose the number of plugs the machine will contain, the letters contained in the plugs, as well as the types and position of the rotors and reflectors.
Also, the user can input the letter they want to encode and the encoded version of it will be displayed at the same time.

How to run:

Due to the large output some of the methods display, all methods that make the machine work are commented in the Main class which contains the main method.
To run the code, please uncomment the method you want to run, save/compile and run.
